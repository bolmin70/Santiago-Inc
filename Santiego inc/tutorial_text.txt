Welcome to Santiago Integral, a game about learning new stuff and catching criminals

Before we get into action, lets teach you the ropes


This is your base, here you can take new quests

Welcome to the world map

squares are locations that you can visit

the square filled with red is your current position


this the HUD 

this represents how much money you have
this tells you the current time in Santiago
and this only appears during missions telling you how much time you have before the arrest warrant expires


okay so lets start looking for the criminal

choose a random region, do it by clicking the square


here you have the region panel

depending on the teritory you choosen there are possible countries to choose

you can choose to travel to a certain country by clicking on its name

remember traveling takes time!

here you can select the plane type, the more expensive the plane the faster you will get to your desired location


now you are in the country panel

here you can start looking for clues about the criminals location

you can do so by pressing the 'binoculars' icon

remember looking for clues takes time!

now you have a question to answer, if you answer correctly you will get access to a clue




Great! you answered correctly!

now you get access to the clue

read it carefully and go to the world map by clicking the 'map' icon

now look for a region that the clue points to
